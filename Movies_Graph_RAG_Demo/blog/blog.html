        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/ai_generated_blog_image.png" alt="blog banner image for a quick visual understanding of the POC" class="banner-image">
        <h1>My Journey Exploring RAG vs GraphRAG</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I knew what was RAG and GraphRAG, but didn't clearly understood how only the relationships in GraphRAG were performing better than simple/plain RAGs, so I did a POC to see if it does really make sense.</p>
        <p>There are many relationship based systems(fraud detection, social media recommendation, etc) where GraphRAG is really useful that could be picked up for the POC but I wanted something simple yet close to my passion, so I picked up the movie recommendation system which has entities/nodes like movies, actors, genres, directors, etc and relationship among them is easy to understand for everyone too.</p>
        
        <h2>Tech Stack / Tools</h2>
        <div class="tech-stack">
            <ul>
                <li>Neo4j for graph building logic</li>
                <li>TMDB API for movies data</li>
                <li>Open AI API for LLM integration</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Source Code:</h2>
        <p>I've made all the code available in my <a href="https://github.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/tree/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo">GitHub repository</a>, so that you don't have to read my BS in this blog.</p>
        <p>Just run the Jupyter notebook and explore it yourself or if you don't want to even do that, then just watch the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/demo.gif">demo gif</a> in the repo</p>
        
        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        
        <h3>Fetch movies data</h3>
        <p><strong>note:</strong> I kept it intentionally small - just 15 artists and their top movies with some hardcoded popular names from Tamil Cinema.</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
# Initialize TMDB client
tmdb_api_key = os.getenv('TMDB_API_KEY')
if not tmdb_api_key:
    print("❌ Please set TMDB_API_KEY in your .env file")
    print("Get your API key from: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api")
else:
    tmdb_client = TMDBClient(tmdb_api_key)
    print("✅ TMDB client initialized")
        </div>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/1.png" alt="TMDB Client Initialization">
        
        <h3>Building the Knowledge Graph</h3>
        <p>First, I needed to create a proper knowledge graph. I used Neo4j to model the relationships:</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
// My graph schema
CREATE (m:Movie {title: "The Dark Knight", rating: 9.0})
CREATE (a:Person {name: "Christian Bale", type: "Actor"})
CREATE (g:Genre {name: "Action"})
CREATE (d:Person {name: "Christopher Nolan", type: "Director"})

CREATE (a)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
CREATE (m)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g)
CREATE (d)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)
        </div>
        
        <p>The graph structure was simple but powerful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Movies</strong> connected to <strong>Actors</strong> via <code>ACTED_IN</code></li>
            <li><strong>Movies</strong> connected to <strong>Directors</strong> via <code>DIRECTED</code></li>
            <li><strong>Movies</strong> connected to <strong>Genres</strong> via <code>HAS_GENRE</code></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The RAG Implementation: Vector Similarity</h3>
        <p>For regular RAG, I created text embeddings from movie metadata:</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
class SimpleRAG:
    def add_documents(self, df):
        for _, row in df.iterrows():
            doc_text = f"""
            Movie: {row['movie_title']}
            Overview: {row['movie_overview']}
            Genres: {', '.join(row['movie_genres'])}
            Cast: {', '.join(row['movie_cast'])}
            Directors: {', '.join(row['movie_directors'])}
            """
            self.documents.append({'text': doc_text, 'metadata': row.to_dict()})
        
        # Create embeddings
        self.embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(texts)
        </div>
        
        <p>This approach treats each movie as a flat text document and uses cosine similarity to find relevant matches.</p>
        
        <h3>The GraphRAG Implementation: Relationship Traversal</h3>
        <p>For GraphRAG, I implemented graph traversal to extract contextual relationships:</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
def extract_subgraph_context(self, query):
    # Query the graph based on relationships
    cypher_query = f"""
    MATCH (m:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
    WHERE {genre_filter}
    WITH m, collect(g.name) as genres
    MATCH (m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
    WITH m, genres, collect(p.name) as actors
    MATCH (m)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person)
    WITH m, genres, actors, collect(d.name) as directors
    RETURN m.title, m.overview, genres, actors, directors
    """
        </div>
        
        <p>This approach leverages the graph structure to find movies through their relationships, not just text similarity.</p>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/2.png" alt="GraphRAG Implementation">
        
        <h3>Visualising the Graph</h3>
        <p>I created a simple graph visualization to see what was happening:</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
def visualize_graph_sample(neo4j_uri, neo4j_user, neo4j_password, limit=20):
    # Get a sample of the graph
    result = session.run(f"""
        MATCH (m:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre)
        WITH m, collect(g.name) as genres
        MATCH (m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p:Person)
        WITH m, genres, collect(p.name)[0..2] as actors
        RETURN m.title as movie, genres, actors
        LIMIT {limit}
    """)
    
    # Create NetworkX graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    # ... visualization code
        </div>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/3.png" alt="Graph Visualization">
        
        <h3>The First Test: Action Movies</h3>
        <p>I started with a simple query: <em>"Recommend action movies with great actors"</em></p>
        
        <h4>Regular RAG Results:</h4>
        <div class="results-box">
            <pre>1. Ra.One (similarity: 0.583)
2. Vettaiyan (similarity: 0.440)
3. Michael Madana Kama Rajan (similarity: 0.431)</pre>
        </div>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/4.png" alt="RAG Results">
        
        <p>The RAG system found movies that contained the words "action" and "actors" in their metadata. Pretty straightforward stuff.</p>
        <p>We already noticed a few issues wrt results where the first 2 were actions flicks though mediocre ones but the last one MMKR wasn't much of an action flick so we know where RAG system really lacks now, it doesn't really know the context since the relationships are missing which plays a crucial part in adding extra relevant context. Now, lets see the results of GraphRAG.</p>
        
        <h4>GraphRAG Results:</h4>
        <div class="results-box">
            <pre>Amaran
Ko
Sivaji: The Boss
Indian
Paiyaa</pre>
        </div>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/5.png" alt="GraphRAG Results">
        
        <p>The GraphRAG system found movies through <em>relationships</em> - shared actors, directors, and genre connections. The reasoning was more contextual.</p>
        <p>We could already see that the GraphRAG worked really well by picking exactly only the action movies and that too the great ones which showcases adding more context through relationships does help LLMs in picking more right choices.</p>
        
        <h3>The Comedy Test: A Surprising Success</h3>
        <p>Next, I tried: <em>"I want comedy movies with good ratings"</em></p>
        
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saru2020/AI_POCs/main/Movies_Graph_RAG_Demo/blog/screenshots/6.png" alt="Comedy Test Results">
